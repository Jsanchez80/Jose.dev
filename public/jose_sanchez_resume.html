		<section class="center">
			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
				I've spent my career in management and during my career, I constantly sought tools and technology that allowed my team to perform effectively and empower them to deliver world class customer service. Unfortunately, the technology was never quite up to par or didn't exist. With this came quite a few headaches and many sleepless nights; I've decided to make a career change and begin developing tools that create change and spark excitement in fields such as 3rd party logistics, staffing and recruitment and increasing productivity.  Check out some of my teams work below and if you're searching for team member that adds value through solving and devloping process tools, reach out to me. Enjoy!!!
